USER INTERFACE

The online pharmacy app is the name of our web application. We all know that because of Covid-19, people are trying hard to stay socially distant. In the light of the world's current stance, I am proposing the online pharmacy app whose ultimate goal is to help people stay safe, especially those with underlying health conditions. This app will solve a few problems like preventing long waits in queues and going to crowded marketplaces. Through this app, customers will be able to order their medicine and get it delivered to their houses which is very convenient. And also it would be very beneficial to the old folks that cannot drive, to those that do not have a car, and to the people with physical handicaps. The app is designed to be very simple, very friendly-user. It will generate revenue and will create jobs. The apllication interface will main pages will be the home page where users will be allowed to login or create an account, the product page, the social media page...

Features from an end-user standpoint • Customers will be able to create an account.

We will be using the Node.js Express to design the backend of our application. This web development framework will enable us to add specific handling for different HTTP verbs like GET, POST, DELETE, and so on… It will also separately handle requests at different URL paths and serve static files.

The first important layer that our backend service will provide is the ROUTE. A route within an API is a specific path to take to get specific information or data out of a website database in other words this is a way for the user to request information through the API. The second layer that we will rely on is the controller service. Controllers are the gateways into the web API for client applications via HTTP requests. They represent request and response models for controller methods, request models define the parameters for incoming requests, and response models define the data that is returned. Technically, this is how our backend service will be operating.
